## Architecture
- The application was built based on the following:

1.Dependency Injection: Dagger Hilt is used.

2.Architecture Pattern : MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is used in this project.

3.I connect the app with Firebase for Sign in & sign up by three ways: Phone Number Or Google Or Facebook.

4.Also, I used roomdatabase to make sign in & sign up.

5.I Used JetPack Compose Tecnology in this app to design the Ui Structure rather than Xml language.

6.I used free api for countries informations, when use https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all.
